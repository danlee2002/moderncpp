### Introduction:
Consider the following snippet of code.
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
int main() {
    int result = add(1,2);
    return 0;
}
```
It's clear, that the following piece of code adds two integers and performs these operation in runtime.
What if we instead perform a one time calculation and preprocess so that it's not performed at runtime.
That where the `constexpr` keyword comes in dandy. Note that any value assigned with constexpr is immutable by nature. 
```cpp
constexpr int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
int main() {
    constexpr int result = add(1,2);
    return 0;
}
```
Now consider the following asm generated by the first example:
```asm
 movl    $3, %esi
        movl    $2, %edi
        call    sum(int, int)
        movl    %eax, -4(%rbp)
```
As one can see we defined a subroutine to perform addition.
Now consider the asm code generated by adding constexpr.
The part that handles addition can be found here.
```asm
movl    $5, -8(%rbp)
```
Rather than peforming a subroutine to add. We simply load the value to the approriate location.
